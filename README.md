👋 Hi there! I'm a 22-year-old computer science and engineering enthusiast currently diving deep into the world of technology at LTH (Lund Tekniska Högskola) in the city of Lund, Sweden. 🇸🇪<br><br>👨‍💻 When I'm not buried in textbooks or coding away on my latest projects, you can find me exploring the vast and exciting world of programming. I currently have a particular interest with Python 🐍 and Java ☕, with occasional forays into C and C++ for that extra challenge. 🏢 Professionally, I'm honing my skills part-time at Axis Communications, also based in Lund. Here, I'm part of a dynamic team where I contribute to software projects 🖥️ and gather data for our radar algorithms 📡. It's a perfect blend of theory and practice that constantly pushes me to learn and grow.<br><br>🕺 Outside the digital realm I cherish the moments spent with friends, immersing myself in various university events 🎓, and staying active. Most days, you'll find me hitting the gym 🏋️‍♂️, where I channel the same dedication and focus I apply to my studies and work.<br><br>💡 Whether it's mastering a new programming language, collaborating on innovative projects, or simply enjoying a good workout, I believe in embracing every experience with enthusiasm and an open mind.<br><br>🔍 Feel free to explore my GitHub to see what I've been up to lately. From academic projects to personal endeavors, I love the journey of discovery and innovation that technology offers.
